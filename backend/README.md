## WHY?

This is the backend library for the Tamed Stripe architecture. This library aims to provide the backend integrations with the Stripe API servers for basic customer generation, connected account generation, payment and refund functions.

## SETUP

1. Add the backend library to the backend of your project.

```bash
yarn add tamed-stripe-backend
```

2. Initialize parameters (modify below object according to your environment)

	Use [this file](https://github.com/MehmetKaplan/tamed-stripe/blob/master/example/backend/server-parameters.js) as a template for your backend configuration. This file is to be `require`d by your express server in the next step. **You should modify the credentials, according to your environment.**

	| Key | Type | Value |
	| --- | --- | --- |
	| pgKeys | Object | PostgreSQL connection parameters. |
	| httpsKeys | Object | HTTPS connection parameters. |
	| port | Number | Port number for the server. |
	
3. Call the `init` function of the library to initialize the db connection pool. And then start your server. As a reference you can use [this file](https://github.com/MehmetKaplan/tamed-stripe/blob/master/example/backend/server.js).
